# JHU Social Science Computation (Economics-focused)

The main documentation lives in:

- **Choose your navigation approach:**
  - **By audience/role** (faculty, students, staff): [`docs/by-role.md`](docs/by-role.md)
  - **By mission/goal** (what you want to achieve): [`docs/by-mission.md`](docs/by-mission.md)

- **Full index (journey/tasks + reference):** [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md)

The underlying pages are written as **standalone** task and reference docs so either navigation approach can link to the same core content with minimal duplication.
