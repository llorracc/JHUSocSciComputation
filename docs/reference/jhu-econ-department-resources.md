# JHU Economics Department computational / AI / data support (econ.jhu.edu)

This page is intentionally **minimal and stable**: it points to a small number of *authoritative* department pages that are likely to remain valid over time, and it provides search/prompt templates to help you find the most current answers quickly.

## 1) Start here (stable entry link)

- **Economics staff directory (authoritative)**: `https://econ.jhu.edu/people/staff/`

Use that page to find the **current** person for department-local support roles (titles and names can change).

## 2) What to look for on the staff page

When you open the staff directory, look for roles like:

- **IT** (local computing help, accounts, printers, device/network questions)
- **Computer Lab Liaison / lab support** (department labs, shared machines, local lab software)
- **Web Liaison / web support** (department web requests, posting/updating pages)

Avoid relying on names, phone numbers, and office locations in a static doc—those details can change frequently.

## 3) Fast Google searches (copy/paste)

Use these searches to find the newest official info:

- `site:econ.jhu.edu staff IT`
- `site:econ.jhu.edu \"Computer Lab\" liaison`
- `site:econ.jhu.edu \"Web Liaison\"`
- `site:econ.jhu.edu computer lab`
- `site:econ.jhu.edu data` *(to find any departmental data/lab pages, if they exist)*

If Google results are thin, try adding **\"Economics\"**, **\"Wyman Park\"**, or **\"directory\"**.

## 4) Useful AI prompts (copy/paste)

If you use an AI assistant with web access, paste one of these prompts *and include the staff directory URL*:

- “Open `https://econ.jhu.edu/people/staff/`. Who is listed as the best contact for **IT** in the JHU Economics department? Return name, title, and the page URL you used.”
- “From `https://econ.jhu.edu/people/staff/`, identify who handles **computer lab** support. If there is no explicit lab role, say so and suggest the next best contact.”
- “From `https://econ.jhu.edu/people/staff/`, identify who handles **web** updates (web liaison/web support).”

If you want help routing a question, use:

- “I’m in JHU Economics. I need help with: <describe problem>. Based on `https://econ.jhu.edu/people/staff/`, which role should I contact (IT vs lab vs web), and what exact words should I use in my email?”

## 5) What to include when asking for help (so you get a fast answer)

Include:

- **What you’re trying to do** (e.g., install software, access a lab machine, publish a page, move data)
- **What system/platform** (Rockfish/DISCOVERY/JHPCE/SciServer/local lab machine)
- **Deadline/urgency**
- Any constraints: **PHI/PII**, DUA, MFA/VPN issues
