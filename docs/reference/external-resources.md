- **QuantEcon**: `https://quantecon.org/`  
  Open educational materials and software for quantitative/computational economics (including online lectures and open-source libraries, especially in Python and Julia).

- **Econ-ARK**: `https://econ-ark.org/`  
  Open-source tools, code, and model implementations for computational economics (notably heterogeneous-agent / micro-to-macro work), plus educational resources and reproducible research artifacts.
