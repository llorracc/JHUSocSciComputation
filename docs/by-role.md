# Navigate by audience/role (faculty, students, staff)

This page is an **entry point** organized by *who you are*. It minimizes duplication by linking to a small set of shared, standalone pages (tasks + reference) that can also be reached from the mission-based entry point.

## Faculty

- **Get oriented / new project checklist**: [Start here: new faculty / new project setup](start-here/new-faculty.md)
- **Choose where to compute**: [Platform comparison](reference/platforms.md)
- **Run large jobs (HPC, GPUs, Slurm)**: [Run large jobs](tasks/run-large-jobs.md)
- **Work with sensitive or restricted data (PHI/PII, DUAs)**: [Sensitive/restricted data](tasks/work-with-sensitive-data.md)
- **Use AI for writing and coding (HopGPT, Copilot, etc.)**: [AI for writing and coding](tasks/ai-for-writing-and-coding.md)
- **Find software subscriptions / request software**: [Software and subscriptions](tasks/software-and-subscriptions.md)

## Students (PhD / grad / undergrad doing research)

- **Get oriented / research checklist**: [Start here: PhD students](start-here/phd-students.md)
- **Choose where to compute**: [Platform comparison](reference/platforms.md)
- **Run large jobs (HPC, GPUs, Slurm)**: [Run large jobs](tasks/run-large-jobs.md)
- **Work with sensitive or restricted data (PHI/PII, DUAs)**: [Sensitive/restricted data](tasks/work-with-sensitive-data.md)
- **Use AI for writing and coding (HopGPT, Copilot, etc.)**: [AI for writing and coding](tasks/ai-for-writing-and-coding.md)
- **Find software subscriptions / request software**: [Software and subscriptions](tasks/software-and-subscriptions.md)

## Staff (research support, admin, IT, lab managers)

- **Support-oriented checklist**: [Start here: staff / research support](start-here/staff.md)
- **Choose where a project should run**: [Platform comparison](reference/platforms.md)
- **Guidance for compliant workflows**: [Sensitive/restricted data](tasks/work-with-sensitive-data.md)
- **Help people run compute safely and efficiently**: [Run large jobs](tasks/run-large-jobs.md)
- **Help people pick and use institutional tools**: [AI for writing and coding](tasks/ai-for-writing-and-coding.md)
- **Help people find/request software**: [Software and subscriptions](tasks/software-and-subscriptions.md)

## Shared “reference” pages

- **Platform comparison**: [Rockfish vs DISCOVERY vs JHPCE vs SciServer vs Cloud](reference/platforms.md)
- **Rockfish / Slurm primer (appendix)**: [Rockfish / Slurm primer](reference/rockfish-slurm-primer.md)
