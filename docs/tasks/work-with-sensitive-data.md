# Task: work with sensitive or restricted data (PHI/PII, DUAs)

This page is about choosing tools and workflows that match JHU policy and your data obligations.

## Start with policy and “approved tools”

- **Responsible use of AI** (IT@JH): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-ai/`
- **Approved GenAI tools list** (IT@JH): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/`

## AI: what to use (and what not to use) with sensitive data

- **HopGPT** (`chat.ai.jh.edu`) is described by IT@JH as a secure, JHED-authenticated platform with access to multiple models (including Anthropic) and approved for PHI/PII, with additional notes about IRB/SIP requirements: `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/hopgpt/`
- Do **not** paste restricted or proprietary JHU data into **unapproved** third‑party AI tools or personal accounts (per IT@JH guidance): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-ai/`

## Compute and storage options mentioned in JHU documentation

- **Research IT DISCOVERY (HPC)** is described as **PHI-compliant** for analysis and storage: `https://researchit.jhu.edu/research-hpc/`
- **SAFE / SAFER virtual desktops + SAFESTOR** are listed by Research IT as secure analytic and storage options: `https://researchit.jhu.edu/storage-access/`

## Meetings, transcription, and bots

IT@JH documents that external meeting-assistant bots (e.g., Read.ai, Otter.ai) are blocked/disabled and provides preferred alternatives and retention notes:

- `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/meeting-assistants/`

## Practical checklist

- **Before you start**: document your data sources, restrictions, and any DUA/IRB conditions.
- **Pick the environment first** (compute + storage), then decide what tools can run inside it.
- **Treat “personal subscriptions” as personal** unless JHU explicitly documents an enterprise agreement for your unit or the university.
