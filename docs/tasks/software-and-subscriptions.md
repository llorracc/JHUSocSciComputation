# Task: find software subscriptions and request new software

JHU does not publish a single static public list of every license/subscription. Instead, JHU documentation points to **catalog portals** as the authoritative place to browse what’s available.

## Where to browse “what JHU has”

### 1) Campus-wide catalog (“mySoftware”)

WSE IT describes this as “a larger list of general Johns Hopkins software packages.”

- **Start**: `https://my.jh.edu/`
- **Navigate**: Technology → mySoftware (Software Catalog)
- Source: `https://wseit.engineering.jhu.edu/get-help/software-downloads/`

Engineering for Professionals provides step-by-step instructions and examples (Office, Windows, Adobe, Mathematica, MATLAB):

- `https://ep.jhu.edu/faculty-staff/getting-started/software-and-hardware-purchases-and-downloads`

### 2) WSE Software Library (WSE-procured licenses)

WSE IT documents a WSE software library at `https://software.wse.jhu.edu` and notes it often requires campus network access or VPN:

## When you can’t find what you need

At least in Johns Hopkins Medicine contexts, IT@JH documents a “Software Intake Process (SIP)” for software purchased outside the JH mySoftware/ServiceNow catalog:

- `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/governance-committees-it-policies/the-software-intake-process-sip-requesting-a-new-software-based-solution/`

## Examples of subscriptions documented elsewhere

Some subscriptions are documented in unit-specific support pages rather than the campus-wide catalog:

- **Overleaf Professional (WSE)**: `https://support.cmts.jhu.edu/hc/en-us/articles/17415635014029-Overleaf-Professional-Accounts-at-WSE`
- **Copilot for M365 (orderable add-on)**: `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/microsoft-copilot/`
