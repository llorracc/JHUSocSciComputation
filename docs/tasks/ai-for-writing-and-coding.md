# Task: use AI for writing and coding (HopGPT, Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Overleaf)

This page summarizes the most relevant **institutional** AI and writing tools for research and teaching workflows.

## Start with institutional guidance

- **Approved GenAI tools** (IT@JH): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/`
- **Guidelines for responsible use** (IT@JH): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-ai/`

## AI chat / LLMs

- **HopGPT** (`chat.ai.jh.edu`): IT@JH describes a secure, JHED-authenticated platform providing access to multiple models including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta (and notes PHI/PII approval with IRB/SIP caveats): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/hopgpt/`
- **WSE-specific guidance** (practical “what to use” summary for WSE affiliates): `https://wseit.engineering.jhu.edu/get-help/generative-ai-chatgpt-information/`

## AI in Microsoft 365

- **Copilot for M365**: IT@JH documents capabilities and procurement details (fee-based add-on via Software Catalog): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/microsoft-copilot/`

## Coding assistants (GitHub Copilot)

- **Documented JHU usage**: IT@JH feature story on GitHub Copilot use in VS Code / JetBrains: `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/featured-articles/github-copilot-helps-software-engineers-save-time-and-increase-productivity/`
- **Group licensing / paid add-ons**: JHU OSPO documents how to request paid GitHub add-ons (including Copilot Business/Enterprise) for GitHub Organizations: `https://ospo.library.jhu.edu/services/github-enterprise/github-paid-add-ons/`

## Writing and citations

- **Overleaf (WSE-provided)**: WSE provides Overleaf Professional features and a login path via `overleaf.com/edu/jhu`: `https://support.cmts.jhu.edu/hc/en-us/articles/17415635014029-Overleaf-Professional-Accounts-at-WSE`
- **Citation managers** (Sheridan Libraries): RefWorks (free for JHU users), EndNote, Mendeley, Zotero: `https://guides.library.jhu.edu/citing/citationtools`

## Tools not found as centrally supported (as of this review)

I did not locate JHU-controlled pages indicating central licensing/subsidies for:

- Paperpile
- Litmaps
- Mathpix
- Cursor
- “Claude Code” (as a specific CLI/product)

That does not imply prohibition—only that **central support wasn’t clearly documented** in the sources used for this guide. For any third-party AI tools, follow IT@JH guidance above.
