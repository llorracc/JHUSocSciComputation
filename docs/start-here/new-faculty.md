# Start here: new faculty / new project setup

This page is a quick checklist to get you to “I can compute, I can store data, and I know where to ask for help.”

## 1) Make sure the basics work

- **JHED + MFA**: most services assume JHED authentication and multi-factor.
- **VPN**: some JHU sites and software portals require campus network or VPN.
- **Data classification**: decide early whether your project involves PHI/PII, restricted data, DUAs, or other sensitive inputs.

## 2) Pick the right compute environment

Use the platform comparison table first:

- [Platform comparison](../reference/platforms.md)

If you already know what you need:

- **ARCH Rockfish (HPC)**: shared Slurm cluster. Start at `https://docs.arch.jhu.edu/en/latest/` and allocations policy `https://www.arch.jhu.edu/policies/allocations/` (ColdFront portal: `https://coldfront.rockfish.jhu.edu/`).
- **Research IT DISCOVERY (HPC)**: PHI-compliant HPC with Slurm + OnDemand (RStudio/Jupyter/VS Code/Matlab): `https://researchit.jhu.edu/research-hpc/`.
- **JHPCE (HPC)**: BSPH-hosted Slurm cluster with large storage + GPUs (H100/V100/A100): `https://jhpce.jhu.edu/`.
- **SciServer**: “analysis close to the data” cyberinfrastructure with Jupyter-in-containers: `https://www.idies.jhu.edu/what-we-offer/sciserver/`.

## 3) Set up storage and transfers

Research IT summarizes storage/access options (including AWS/Azure subscription requests, Enterprise NAS, SAFE/SAFER, SAFESTOR):

- `https://researchit.jhu.edu/storage-access/`

## 4) Decide your AI tool(s) early (and safely)

- **Approved GenAI tools list** (IT@JH): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/`
- **Responsible use guidance** (IT@JH): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-ai/`
- **HopGPT** (secure, JHED-authenticated access to models including Anthropic): `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/hopgpt/`

For sensitive data, see:

- [Work with sensitive/restricted data](../tasks/work-with-sensitive-data.md)

## 5) Know who to contact

- **ARCH / Rockfish support**: `help@arch.jhu.edu` (also referenced in ARCH docs)
- **Research IT**: use the intake/support links on `https://researchit.jhu.edu/research-hpc/`
- **JHPCE**: `jhpce@jhu.edu` (JHPCE site)
- **WSE IT / CMTS / CTLD** (if you are WSE-affiliated or collaborating with WSE):
  - WSE IT: `https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty-staff/contact-wse-it`
  - CMTS support center: `https://support.cldt.jhu.edu/hc/en-us`
  - CTLD GenAI resources: `https://engineering.jhu.edu/ctld/chatgpt/ai-tools/`
- **Library data services**: `https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/`
