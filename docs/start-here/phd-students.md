# Start here: PhD students

This page is a short checklist for economics and social-science PhD students at JHU: compute, storage, AI tools, and who to ask.

## 1) Basics

- **JHED + MFA**: most JHU research services use JHED and multi-factor authentication.
- **VPN**: some portals and software require campus network or VPN.
- **Data**: if your project uses PHI/PII, restricted data, or data under a DUA, follow JHU policies and use approved environments (e.g. DISCOVERY for PHI).

## 2) Where to run your code

Use the platform comparison first:

- [Platform comparison](../reference/platforms.md)

Common choices:

- **ARCH Rockfish (HPC)**: shared Slurm cluster. Good for heavy estimation, replication, and batch jobs. Start at [ARCH docs](https://docs.arch.jhu.edu/en/latest/); allocations via [ColdFront](https://coldfront.rockfish.jhu.edu/). Your advisor or department may have an allocation you can use.
- **JHPCE**: BSPH-hosted HPC with large storage and GPUs (H100/V100/A100). See [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/).
- **Research IT DISCOVERY**: PHI-compliant HPC with Slurm and OnDemand (RStudio, Jupyter, VS Code, Matlab). See [Research HPC](https://researchit.jhu.edu/research-hpc/).
- **SciServer**: Jupyter-in-containers, “analysis close to the data.” See [SciServer](https://www.idies.jhu.edu/what-we-offer/sciserver/).

## 3) Storage and moving data

Research IT summarizes storage and transfer options (including Enterprise NAS, SAFE/SAFER, AWS/Azure requests):

- [Research IT storage and access](https://researchit.jhu.edu/storage-access/)

## 4) AI for writing and coding

JHU’s approved GenAI tools and responsible-use guidance:

- [IT@JH AI](https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/)
- [Guidelines for responsible use of AI](https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-ai/)
- **HopGPT** (JHED-authenticated, secure access to models including Anthropic): [HopGPT](https://it.johnshopkins.edu/ai/hopgpt/)

More detail:

- [AI for writing and coding](../tasks/ai-for-writing-and-coding.md)

For sensitive data, use only approved tools and environments:

- [Work with sensitive or restricted data](../tasks/work-with-sensitive-data.md)

## 5) Who to contact

- **Your advisor / program**: for allocation access, project-specific software, and data agreements.
- **ARCH / Rockfish**: [help@arch.jhu.edu](mailto:help@arch.jhu.edu) (see [ARCH docs](https://docs.arch.jhu.edu/en/latest/)).
- **Research IT**: intake and support links on [Research HPC](https://researchit.jhu.edu/research-hpc/).
- **JHPCE**: [jhpce@jhu.edu](mailto:jhpce@jhu.edu) (see [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/)).
- **Library data services**: [dataservices.library.jhu.edu](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/).
