# Start here: staff / research support

This page is a lightweight checklist for **staff** who support faculty and students (department admins, research support staff, IT partners, lab managers). It is designed to be **link-heavy** so the core guidance lives in shared pages that both “role-based” and “mission-based” navigation can point to.

## 1) Triage questions quickly

Before you route someone to a system, collect:

- **Who is the PI / sponsoring unit?** (often determines what allocations, storage, or managed services are available)
- **What’s the data classification?** (PHI/PII, DUAs, restricted data)
- **What’s the workload?** (interactive analysis vs batch jobs, GPU needs, storage/transfer needs)

## 2) Start with the shared comparison and task pages

- **Choose a compute environment**: [Platform comparison](../reference/platforms.md)
- **Run large jobs (HPC, GPUs, Slurm)**: [Run large jobs](../tasks/run-large-jobs.md)
- **Sensitive/restricted data workflows**: [Work with sensitive or restricted data](../tasks/work-with-sensitive-data.md)
- **AI tools and policy**: [AI for writing and coding](../tasks/ai-for-writing-and-coding.md)
- **Software subscriptions / requests**: [Software and subscriptions](../tasks/software-and-subscriptions.md)

## 3) Common “where to send people”

- **Economics department contacts** (staff directory, including department IT / lab liaison roles): `https://econ.jhu.edu/people/staff/` (see also: `https://econ.jhu.edu/people/faculty/`)
- **ARCH / Rockfish (HPC)**: start at `https://docs.arch.jhu.edu/en/latest/` and allocations via `https://coldfront.rockfish.jhu.edu/` (policy: `https://www.arch.jhu.edu/policies/allocations/`).
- **Research IT DISCOVERY (HPC, PHI-compliant)**: `https://researchit.jhu.edu/research-hpc/` (Research IT intake: `https://researchit.jhu.edu/forms/intake/`).
- **JHPCE (HPC)**: `https://jhpce.jhu.edu/`.
- **General JHU IT help**: IT@JH Solution Center `https://it.johnshopkins.edu/it-services/solution-center/` (ServiceNow portal: `https://johnshopkins.service-now.com/serviceportal`).

## 4) When in doubt

Use the platform comparison first, then route based on **data obligations** (PHI/PII → approved environments) and **workload** (batch/GPU needs).
