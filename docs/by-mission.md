# Navigate by mission (what goal do you want to achieve?)

This page is an **entry point** organized by *what you’re trying to do*. It minimizes duplication by pointing to shared, standalone pages (tasks + reference) that can also be reached from the role-based entry point.

## 1) “I’m new — where should I start?”

- Faculty: [Start here: new faculty / new project setup](start-here/new-faculty.md)
- Students: [Start here: PhD students](start-here/phd-students.md)
- Staff/support: [Start here: staff / research support](start-here/staff.md)

## 2) “Where should I run my work?” (choose a compute environment)

- [Platform comparison](reference/platforms.md)

If you will use Rockfish/Slurm, this appendix is handy:
